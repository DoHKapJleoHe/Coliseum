# Coliseum: C# course project.

Task:
Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg decided to fight in a duel in the Roman Coliseum. The Gods got angry at them: they grabbed them and locked in two different rooms. They agree to release Mark and Elon if they solve one problem.

There is a deck of 36 cards. The Gods shuffle the deck, divide it in half and give one half to Elon Musk and the other half to Mark Zuckerberg. Then both look at their cards without shuffling them. Each of them must name the card number in the partnerâ€™s half. If the colors of the selected cards match, they are allowed to fight; otherwise, they are not allowed.

Elon and Mark, like smart guys, foresaw all the circumstances in advance and had the opportunity to agree on strategies for their behavior (they can be as similar as they are different for Elona and Mark).

Goal: find a strategy(s) that allows you to enter the arena with the greatest possible probability.
